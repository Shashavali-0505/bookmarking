    <h3><u>1.What is a Programming language?</u></h3>
    <p>A programming language is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a 
       computer. 
       Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data 
       analysis, and automation. <br>
       Examples: <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php" target="_blank">C</a>,<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp" target="_blank">Java</a>,<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp" target="_blank">Python</a>,<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">javascript.</a></b></p><hr>
    <h3><u>2.Why Python?</u></h3>
    <p> <b>1. Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.<br>
        <b>2. Versatility:</b> Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, 
       functional). <br>
        <b>3. Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web 
       development. <br>
        <b>4. Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning. <br>
        <b>5. Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier. <br>
        <b>6. Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification 
        (Windows, macOS, Linux). <br>
        <b>7 . Scalability: </b>While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications 
        when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g.,<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php" target="_blank">Django</a>) </p><hr>
    <h3><u>3.What is Python?</u></h3>
    <p>1. Python is a <mark><b>high-level, interpreted programming language</b></mark>known for its simplicity and 
        readability. It was created by <mark><b>Guido van Rossum </b></mark> the late 1980s and first released in 1991. 
        Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
        <mark>object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.</mark>

        <h3><u>4.Where Python is Used?</u></h3>
    <p> <b>1. Web Development:</b> Frameworks: Django, Flask. <br>
        <b>2. Data Science and Machine Learning:</b> Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy, 
        Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn. <br>
        <b>3. Automation (Scripting):</b> Automating repetitive tasks. <br>
        <b>4. Game Development: Framework:</b> PyGame. <br>
        <b>5. Scientific Computing: Libraries: </b>SciPy, Matplotlib. <br>
        <b>6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b> Libraries: Keras, PyTorch. <br>
        <b>7. Web Scraping: Libraries:</b> BeautifulSoup, Scrapy. <br>
        <b>8. Cybersecurity:</b> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities. <br>
        <b>Companies using Python: </b>Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, NASA, Uber, Reddit, IBM,

        <h3><u>5.Disadvantages of Python?</u></h3>
        <p>
            1. Slower Execution Speed  <br>
            2. Memory Consumption <br>
            3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) <br>
            4. Runtime Errors <br>
            5. Limited Support for Low-Level Programming.
